        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <div>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </p></li>

                <li><p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</p></li>

                <li><p>Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
                </p></li>

                <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</p></li>
